<h2 id="about_main_c">Welcome to the escape room. This is version 2... <br>
    Some of you may have participated in version one <br> If you did, welcome back!
    If you didn't welcome to the escape room. <br> For those of you who participated
    in the escape room V1, <br> things have changed a little since version 1. <br>
    The Escape Room now has 12 rooms instead of 10, they are varying in difficulty. <br>
    The time has increased to 70 minutes to get out of the 12 rooms. <br> With the new
    release of version 2, we have made major improvements across the board <br> 
    for our virtual escape room services. We hope you can enjoy these servcies <br>
    as a lot of time has been put in since version one was originally created. <br>
    Finally, good luck and have fun!! :)
